# iDAAS-Connect-HIPAA
iDAAS Connect for Processing EDI data - This effort has started to support the HIPAA Compliant 5010 EDI transactions but will be moving into Supply Chain transactions.

The intent of these artifacts to enable
resources to work locally: <br/>
1. platform-addons: needed software to run locally. This currently contains amq-streams-1.5 (which is the upstream of Kafka 2.5)<br/>
2. platform-scripts: support running kafka, creating/listing and deleting topics needed for this solution
   and also building and packaging the solution as well. All the scripts are named to describe their capabilities <br/>
3. platform-testdata: sample transactions to leverage for using the platform. <br/>
4. platform-ddl: The DDL for the database that is used.

# Pre-Setup (Before Running Demo)
For this demonstration we have done the following steps.

1.  Created a MySQL Database named idaas and implemented the DDL found within the platform-ddl into this database
2.  We have created a user idaas with a password @idaas123
3.  We have made sure this user has ALL permissions

We would expect that since these are all parameters within the application.properties file you can change these to your needs and liking.

## Scenario: EDI Data Processing
This repository follows a very common general implementation of processing a file from a filesystem. The intent is to pick 
up the file and process it and then leverage the existing iDaaS-EventBuilder library to show it being processed and manipulated. 

### Integration Data Flow Steps

1. Every 1 minute the defined directory is looked at for any .edi file, if found the file is processed into a matching structure.
2. The data structure is then persisted into a kafka topic.

## Builds
This section will cover both local and automated builds.

### Local Builds
Within the code base you can find the local build commands in the /platform-scripts directory
1.  Run the build-solution.sh script
    It will run the maven commands to build and then package up the solution. The package will use the usual settings
    in the pom.xml file. It pulls the version and concatenates the version to the output jar it builds.
    Additionally, there is a copy statement to remove any specific version, so it outputs idaas-connect-hl7.jar

### Automated Builds
Automated Builds are going to be done in Azure Pipelines
