# iDaaS-Connect
This Repository is meant to provide a single repository for all  
the specific ways iDaaS can Connect to data from various systems. The key that we wanted to provide the industry
with was the ability to have small components that could provide the capability to
connect and route data for specific healthcare industry standards/protocols.
Do not think of these capabilities as anything more than a set of  
design patterns to provide comprehensive connectivity and routing of data.
Data is the asset and this set of repositories is intended to help anyone connect and
build innovative platforms.

design pattern to help meet this critical mandated set of requirements.
